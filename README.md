# DSA Problems and Solutions

This repository will contain my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems in Java Programming language. I'll be tackling problems across different DSA topics, ranging from easy to hard difficulty levels.

## DSA Topics

Here's a breakdown of common DSA topics:

*   Arrays and Strings
*   Linked Lists
*   Trees
*   Graphs
*   Dynamic Programming
*   Recursion and Backtracking
*   Greedy Algorithms
*   Divide and Conquer
*   Hash Tables
*   Heaps
*   Bit Manipulation

*   Sorting Algorithms: 
    *   Merge Sort
    *   Quick Sort
    *   Heap Sort

*   Searching Algorithms:
    *   Linear Search
    *   Binary Search
    *   Depth-First Search (DFS)
    *   Breadth-First Search (BFS)

*   Graph Algorithms:
    *   Dijkstra's Algorithm (Shortest Path)
    *   Bellman-Ford Algorithm (Shortest Path)

    *   Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (All Pairs Shortest Path)
    *   Topological Sort
    *   Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms (Kruskal's, Prim's)

*   String Algorithms:
    *   Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm
    *   Trie
    *   Suffix Array

*   Tree Algorithms:
    *   Tree Traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
